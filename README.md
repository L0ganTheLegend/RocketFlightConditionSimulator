#Rocket Flight Condition Simulator
This program intakes a few different user specified conditions and runs a PID controlled rocket to a specified altitude.

Planned changes:
* Weight effects liftoff
* Gravity falls off at higher altitudes
* More realistic numbers when it comes to speed and fuel usage
